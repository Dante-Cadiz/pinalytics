# Pinalytics

Pinalytics is an interactive bowling scorecard that records and increments scores frame by frame in accordance with the official rule set of 10 pin bowling. 

## Features

- User input field
    - The user inputs their score each frame, consisting of 2 attempts. To signify a strike (successfully knocking over all 10 pins on the first attempt), the user types an "X" in the first input field. For a spare (successfully knocking over all 10 pins within 2 attempts), the user types a "/" in the second input field, along with the score of their first attempt. 
    - These inputs are converted to integer values and stored in an array which is subsequently used to calculate the player's total score round by round. 
    - For the special case of the 10th frame in which the player may gain an extra third attempt if they score a strike or a spare, the form's HTML is updated by a JavaScript function which allows the user to input this possible third attempt.
